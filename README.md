# Portfolio

## What Is A Portfolio?
* A portfolio is a collection of works or projects that showcases an individual's or organization's skills, experience, and achievements in a particular field. In the context of career development or creative industries, such as design, writing, programming, photography, and more, a portfolio serves as a way to demonstrate one's abilities and expertise to potential employers, clients, or collaborators.

## What Was The Problem With Web Page?
* I made my portfolio web page from scratch and i had alots of problem. I could not make it responsive, and i was having problem to understand the flex-box and how that works.
* I always got confused about hoverin over a images and texts. 
* It was hard to navigate through the website because there were too many elements on it.
* When i resized my webpage , everything would go all messy.And i used media queries and i change the width of columns.

## How Did I Solve The Problems?
* I used class"container" to wrap the whole content and set its display property as flex.And i made all the images as a column.

* Fixed the layout issue by using CSS flex box to organize and distribute space for different sections of my portfolio website. 
* This is how it looks like after fixing the problem.

* To make the image appear when you hovered over them, I used CSS :hover selector along with z-index and transform to scale (1.3).
